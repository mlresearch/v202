title: Off-Policy Average Reward Actor-Critic with Deterministic Policy Search
openreview: Tw7pgl861K
abstract: The average reward criterion is relatively less studied as most existing
  works in the Reinforcement Learning literature consider the discounted reward criterion.
  There are few recent works that present on-policy average reward actor-critic algorithms,
  but average reward off-policy actor-critic is relatively less explored. In this
  work, we present both on-policy and off-policy deterministic policy gradient theorems
  for the average reward performance criterion. Using these theorems, we also present
  an Average Reward Off-Policy Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (ARO-DDPG) Algorithm.
  We first show asymptotic convergence analysis using the ODE-based method. Subsequently,
  we provide a finite time analysis of the resulting stochastic approximation scheme
  with linear function approximator and obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal stationary policy
  with a sample complexity of $\Omega(\epsilon^{-2.5})$. We compare the average reward
  performance of our proposed ARO-DDPG algorithm and observe better empirical performance
  compared to state-of-the-art on-policy average reward actor-critic algorithms over
  MuJoCo-based environments.
