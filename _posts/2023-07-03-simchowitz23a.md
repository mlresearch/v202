title: Statistical Learning under Heterogeneous Distribution Shift
openreview: MEnEJqyE4s
abstract: This paper studies the prediction of a target $\mathbf{z}$ from a pair of
  random variables $(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where the ground-truth predictor is
  additive $\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{z} \mid \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}] = f_\star(\mathbf{x})
  +g_{\star}(\mathbf{y})$. We study the performance of empirical risk minimization
  (ERM) over functions $f+g$, $f \in \mathcal{F}$ and $g \in \mathcal{G}$, fit on
  a given training distribution, but evaluated on a test distribution which exhibits
  covariate shift. We show that, when the class $\mathcal{F}$ is "simpler" than $\mathcal{G}$
  (measured, e.g., in terms of its metric entropy), our predictor is more resilient
  to <em>heterogeneous covariate shifts</em> in which the shift in $\mathbf{x}$ is
  much greater than that in $\mathbf{y}$. These results rely on a novel HÃ¶lder style
  inequality for the Dudley integral which may be of independent interest. Moreover,
  we corroborate our theoretical findings with experiments demonstrating improved
  resilience to shifts in "simpler" features across numerous domains.
