title: 'Nesterov Meets Optimism: Rate-Optimal Separable Minimax Optimization'
openreview: 4GM3Ak3B3e
abstract: We propose a new first-order optimization algorithm — AcceleratedGradient-OptimisticGradient
  (AG-OG) Descent Ascent—for separable convex-concave minimax optimization. The main
  idea of our algorithm is to carefully leverage the structure of the minimax problem,
  performing Nesterov acceleration on the individual component and optimistic gradient
  on the coupling component. Equipped with proper restarting, we show that AG-OG achieves
  the optimal convergence rate (up to a constant) for a variety of settings, including
  bilinearly coupled strongly convex-strongly concave minimax optimization (bi-SC-SC),
  bilinearly coupled convex-strongly concave minimax optimization (bi-C-SC), and bilinear
  games. We also extend our algorithm to the stochastic setting and achieve the optimal
  convergence rate in both bi-SC-SC and bi-C-SC settings. AG-OG is the first single-call
  algorithm with optimal convergence rates in both deterministic and stochastic settings
  for bilinearly coupled minimax optimization problems.
