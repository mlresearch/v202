title: 'Do Embodied Agents Dream of Pixelated Sheep: Embodied Decision Making using
  Language Guided World Modelling'
openreview: Rm5Qi57C5I
abstract: 'Reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically learn tabula rasa, without
  prior knowledge of the world. However, if initialized with knowledge of high-level
  subgoals and transitions between subgoals, RL agents could utilize this Abstract
  World Model (AWM) for planning and exploration. We propose using few-shot large
  language models (LLMs) to hypothesize an AWM, that will be verified through world
  experience, to improve sample efficiency of RL agents. Our DECKARD agent applies
  LLM-guided exploration to item crafting in Minecraft in two phases: (1) the Dream
  phase where the agent uses an LLM to decompose a task into a sequence of subgoals,
  the hypothesized AWM; and (2) the Wake phase where the agent learns a modular policy
  for each subgoal and verifies or corrects the hypothesized AWM. Our method of hypothesizing
  an AWM with LLMs and then verifying the AWM based on agent experience not only increases
  sample efficiency over contemporary methods by an order of magnitude but is also
  robust to and corrects errors in the LLM, successfully blending noisy internet-scale
  information from LLMs with knowledge grounded in environment dynamics.'
