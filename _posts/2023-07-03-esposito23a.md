title: 'Delayed Bandits: When Do Intermediate Observations Help?'
openreview: jggvWZLEZa
abstract: We study a $K$-armed bandit with delayed feedback and intermediate observations.
  We consider a model, where intermediate observations have a form of a finite state,
  which is observed immediately after taking an action, whereas the loss is observed
  after an adversarially chosen delay. We show that the regime of the mapping of states
  to losses determines the complexity of the problem, irrespective of whether the
  mapping of actions to states is stochastic or adversarial. If the mapping of states
  to losses is adversarial, then the regret rate is of order $\sqrt{(K+d)T}$ (within
  log factors), where $T$ is the time horizon and $d$ is a fixed delay. This matches
  the regret rate of a $K$-armed bandit with delayed feedback and without intermediate
  observations, implying that intermediate observations are not helpful. However,
  if the mapping of states to losses is stochastic, we show that the regret grows
  at a rate of $\sqrt{\big(K+\min\\{|\mathcal{S}|,d\\}\big)T}$ (within log factors),
  implying that if the number $|\mathcal{S}|$ of states is smaller than the delay,
  then intermediate observations help. We also provide refined high-probability regret
  upper bounds for non-uniform delays, together with experimental validation of our
  algorithms.
