title: Raising the Cost of Malicious AI-Powered Image Editing
openreview: mSKJS7YbwU
abstract: We present an approach to mitigating the risks of malicious image editing
  posed by large diffusion models. The key idea is to immunize images so as to make
  them resistant to manipulation by these models. This immunization relies on injection
  of imperceptible adversarial perturbations designed to disrupt the operation of
  the targeted diffusion models, forcing them to generate unrealistic images. We provide
  two methods for crafting such perturbations, and then demonstrate their efficacy.
  Finally, we discuss a policy component necessary to make our approach fully effective
  and practical—one that involves the organizations developing diffusion models, rather
  than individual users, to implement (and support) the immunization process.
