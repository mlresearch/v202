title: 'Image Shortcut Squeezing: Countering Perturbative Availability Poisons with
  Compression'
openreview: O4hhnt07Yk
abstract: Perturbative availability poisoning (PAP) adds small changes to images to
  prevent their use for model training. Current research adopts the belief that practical
  and effective approaches to countering such poisons do not exist. In this paper,
  we argue that it is time to abandon this belief. We present extensive experiments
  showing that 12 state-of-the-art PAP methods are vulnerable to Image Shortcut Squeezing
  (ISS), which is based on simple compression. For example, on average, ISS restores
  the CIFAR-10 model accuracy to 81.73%, surpassing the previous best preprocessing-based
  countermeasures by 37.97% absolute. ISS also (slightly) outperforms adversarial
  training and has higher generalizability to unseen perturbation norms and also higher
  efficiency. Our investigation reveals that the property of PAP perturbations depends
  on the type of surrogate model used for poison generation, and it explains why a
  specific ISS compression yields the best performance for a specific type of PAP
  perturbation. We further test stronger, adaptive poisoning, and show it falls short
  of being an ideal defense against ISS. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance
  of considering various (simple) countermeasures to ensure the meaningfulness of
  analysis carried out during the development of availability poisons.
