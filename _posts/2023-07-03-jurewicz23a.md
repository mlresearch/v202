title: 'The Catalog Problem: Clustering and Ordering Variable-Sized Sets'
openreview: Pckxn5T0PV
abstract: Prediction of a $\textbf{varying number}$ of $\textbf{ordered clusters}$
  from sets of $\textbf{any cardinality}$ is a challenging task for neural networks,
  combining elements of set representation, clustering and learning to order. This
  task arises in many diverse areas, ranging from medical triage and early discharge,
  through machine part management and multi-channel signal analysis for petroleum
  exploration to product catalog structure prediction. This paper focuses on that
  last area, which exemplifies a number of challenges inherent to adaptive ordered
  clustering, referred to further as the eponymous $\textit{Catalog Problem}$. These
  include learning variable cluster constraints, exhibiting relational reasoning and
  managing combinatorial complexity. Despite progress in both neural clustering and
  set-to-sequence methods, no joint, fully differentiable model exists to-date. We
  develop such a modular architecture, referred to further as Neural Ordered Clusters
  (NOC), enhance it with a specific mechanism for learning cluster-level cardinality
  constraints, and provide a robust comparison of its performance in relation to alternative
  models. We test our method on three datasets, including synthetic catalog structures
  and PROCAT, a dataset of real-world catalogs consisting of over 1.5M products, achieving
  state-of-the-art results on a new, more challenging formulation of the underlying
  problem, which has not been addressed before. Additionally, we examine the network’s
  ability to learn higher-order interactions.
