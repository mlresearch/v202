title: Double-Weighting for Covariate Shift Adaptation
openreview: WlIJAlWou5
abstract: Supervised learning is often affected by a covariate shift in which the
  marginal distributions of instances (covariates $x$) of training and testing samples
  $p_\text{tr}(x)$ and $p_\text{te}(x)$ are different but the label conditionals coincide.
  Existing approaches address such covariate shift by either using the ratio $p_\text{te}(x)/p_\text{tr}(x)$
  to weight training samples (reweighted methods) or using the ratio $p_\text{tr}(x)/p_\text{te}(x)$
  to weight testing samples (robust methods). However, the performance of such approaches
  can be poor under support mismatch or when the above ratios take large values. We
  propose a minimax risk classification (MRC) approach for covariate shift adaptation
  that avoids such limitations by weighting both training and testing samples. In
  addition, we develop effective techniques that obtain both sets of weights and generalize
  the conventional kernel mean matching method. We provide novel generalization bounds
  for our method that show a significant increase in the effective sample size compared
  with reweighted methods. The proposed method also achieves enhanced classification
  performance in both synthetic and empirical experiments.
